ForecastIOLibrary

This library was created for the Android App "Arcus Weather".

This project provides a Java library for using the Forecast.IO weather api.

Please take a look at http://developer.forecast.io to get details on the API. 

I have implemented classes for each data block/point that forecast.io provides.

Please note that this library requires the JSON project that you will need to add to your build path.

I got the .jar file from here:
